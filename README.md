## Description
This is a meal tracking web application. The user can input the name of the food, details about the food and its amount of calories. This information is filled in a form and submitted by clicking on the add button. This information is stored in a list which contains the meals logged by the user. <br/>
The list has the following display options:
* All the meals (this is the default list)
* High calorie meals
* Low calorie meals

The user can also click a food to edit its name, details or calories (in case the user decided to pretend their fries were 100 calories instead of 365).
